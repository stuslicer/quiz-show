A record in Java is not a storage format but a type of class."},{"text":"A type of class that holds a musical record.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. In Java, a record refers to a type of data class, not music-related storage."},{"text":"A special kind of class in Java to model immutable data.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Java records are a special class type used to model immutable data succinctly."},{"text":"A looping structure in Java.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. A record is not a control structure; it is used for data representation."}]},{"number":2,"text":"Which Java version introduced records?","options":[{"text":"Java 8","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Java 8 introduced lambda expressions and streams, not records."},{"text":"Java 11","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Java 11 did not introduce records; it focused on other features."},{"text":"Java 14","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Records were first introduced as a preview feature in Java 14."},{"text":"Java 17","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Java 17 stabilized many features but records were introduced earlier."}]},{"number":3,"text":"What are the key characteristics of records in Java?","options":[{"text":"Mutability and thread-safety","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records are immutable, not mutable."},{"text":"Immutability and transparency","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Records provide immutability and transparency in declaring data carrier classes."},{"text":"Serialization and mutability","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records are immutable and while they can be serialized, it's not a defining characteristic."},{"text":"Extended inheritance and polymorphism","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records have limited inheritance capabilities; they cannot extend another class."}]},{"number":4,"text":"How do you define a record in Java?","options":[{"text":"Using the 'record' keyword followed by a block of fields and methods.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. The syntax misses specifying the constructor parameters."},{"text":"Using the 'class' keyword followed by field declarations.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. This is how a regular class is defined, not a record."},{"text":"Using the 'record' keyword followed by the name, constructor parameters, and a body.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. This is the correct syntax for defining a record in Java."},{"text":"Using the 'interface' keyword and defining properties inside.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Interfaces in Java do not define records or concrete data types."}]},{"number":5,"text":"Can records in Java implement interfaces?","options":[{"text":"No, they cannot implement interfaces.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Java records can implement interfaces."},{"text":"Yes, but only functional interfaces.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records can implement any type of interface, not just functional ones."},{"text":"Yes, they can implement any interfaces.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Records are capable of implementing any interfaces."},{"text":"Yes, but only if they are serializable.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Implementing interfaces in records is not conditional on serialization."}]},{"number":6,"text":"What is automatically provided for a record in Java?","options":[{"text":"A default constructor","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records in Java do not provide a default constructor; they provide a canonical constructor."},{"text":"Private fields and public getters","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Fields in records are final but not private, and there are no conventional getter methods."},{"text":"ToString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Java automatically provides implementations for toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods for records."},{"text":"Static methods","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Static methods are not provided automatically; they must be explicitly defined."}]},{"number":7,"text":"What limitations do records have compared to regular classes?","options":[{"text":"They cannot have instance fields.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Records cannot have instance fields other than the ones defined in the record's state description."},{"text":"They cannot use generics.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records can use generics, allowing them to be more flexible."},{"text":"They can extend other classes.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records cannot extend other classes but can implement interfaces."},{"text":"They have automatic serialization capabilities.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Serialization must be explicitly managed; it is not automatic."}]},{"number":8,"text":"How are the fields of a record in Java declared?","options":[{"text":"As mutable fields within the body.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Record fields are implicitly final and cannot be mutable."},{"text":"In the constructor only.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Fields are declared as part of the record's header, not just in the constructor."},{"text":"As parameters in the record declaration.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Fields in a record are declared as parameters in the record's declaration."},{"text":"As private variables inside the record body.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Record fields are public and not declared inside the body."}]},{"number":9,"text":"Can records in Java be abstract?","options":[{"text":"Yes, they can be abstract to provide partial implementations.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records are intended to be concrete implementations and cannot be abstract."},{"text":"No, records must provide a complete implementation.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Records must be concrete and cannot be abstract, enforcing complete state representation."},{"text":"Yes, they can be abstract if they do not implement any methods.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Even without method implementations, records cannot be abstract."},{"text":"No, unless they are nested within another abstract class.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. The abstractness of a containing class does not affect the concrete nature of records."}]},{"number":10,"text":"What is the primary purpose of using records in Java?","options":[{"text":"To simplify the creation of mutable data objects.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records are intended for immutable data objects."},{"text":"To provide a concise syntax for data carrying classes.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Correct. Records provide a simplified, concise syntax to model data-centric classes."},{"text":"To enhance the capabilities of enums.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records and enums serve different purposes and are not directly related."},{"text":"To replace all uses of traditional classes.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Incorrect. Records are not intended to replace all traditional classes but to offer a simpler option for data carriers."}]}]}
