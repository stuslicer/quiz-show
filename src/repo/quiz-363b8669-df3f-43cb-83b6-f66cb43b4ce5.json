they are used for pattern matching."}]},{"number":2,"text":"What is the purpose of 'Virtual Threads' (JEP 425) in Java 19?","options":[{"text":"To replace traditional Java threads","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Virtual Threads are introduced to complement, not replace, platform threads."},{"text":"To provide a lightweight concurrency model","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Virtual Threads are designed to provide a more efficient, lightweight concurrency model than traditional threads."},{"text":"To enhance the performance of single-thread applications","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Virtual Threads are aimed at improving performance in highly concurrent applications, not specifically single-threaded ones."},{"text":"To integrate better with front-end JavaScript code","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Virtual Threads do not directly relate to front-end JavaScript integration; they address server-side concurrency."}]},{"number":3,"text":"Which new feature in Java 19 helps in simplifying the use of foreign functions and memory?","options":[{"text":"Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"The Foreign Function & Memory API simplifies the interaction with non-Java APIs and foreign memory."},{"text":"Enhanced Enums","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Enhanced Enums is not a feature in Java 19; the Foreign Function and Memory API addresses this purpose."},{"text":"Lambda Improvements","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"While lambda improvements enhance Java's functional programming, they do not deal with foreign functions or memory."},{"text":"Module System Extensions","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Module System Extensions enhance modularity but do not simplify the use of foreign functions or memory."}]},{"number":4,"text":"What is the main focus of the 'Preview: Pattern Matching for switch' (JEP 427) feature in Java 19?","options":[{"text":"Reducing boilerplate in switch blocks","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Pattern Matching for switch aims to reduce boilerplate and increase readability and flexibility in switch cases."},{"text":"Introducing switch expressions to Java","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Switch expressions were introduced before Java 19; this JEP focuses on integrating pattern matching into switch."},{"text":"Deprecating traditional for loops","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"This feature does not relate to deprecating loops but enhances switch statements."},{"text":"Extending switch cases to handle multiple types simultaneously","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"While pattern matching can handle multiple types, the focus is on matching single patterns within switch cases."}]},{"number":5,"text":"How does the 'Structured Concurrency' (JEP 428) in Java 19 improve thread management?","options":[{"text":"By automatically prioritizing thread tasks","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Structured Concurrency doesn't automatically prioritize tasks but aims to simplify the handling of concurrent tasks."},{"text":"By allowing threads to be grouped and managed as a single unit","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"Structured Concurrency introduces the concept of a 'scope' for threads, allowing them to be managed collectively."},{"text":"By integrating more closely with the operating system's scheduler","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"The integration with the OS's scheduler is not the focus; it's about managing concurrency within the application."},{"text":"By eliminating the need for synchronization","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Structured Concurrency simplifies the model but does not eliminate the need for synchronization where necessary."}]},{"number":6,"text":"Which Java 19 feature aims at improving developer productivity by enhancing the Java language with new capabilities?","options":[{"text":"Generics Enhancements","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"While generics are important, the specific enhancements in Java 19 focus on other areas like pattern matching."},{"text":"Preview: Pattern Matching for switch","isCorrect":true,"explanation":"This feature enhances the Java language by allowing more expressive and less error-prone switch statements."},{"text":"Virtual Threads","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"While Virtual Threads improve concurrency, they do not directly enhance the Java language syntax or capabilities."},{"text":"API Documentation Updates","isCorrect":false,"explanation":"Documentation updates improve information accessibility but don't enhance the language itself."}]}]}
